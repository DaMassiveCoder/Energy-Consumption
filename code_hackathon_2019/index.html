    <h4>1. Wind Energy</h4>
    <img src="http://www.japanindustrynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/wind-power-windmill.jpg" alt="">
    <p>
            Wind power or wind energy is the use of air flow through wind turbines to provide the mechanical power to turn electric generators and traditionally to do other work, like milling or pumping. Wind power is a sustainable and renewable alternative to burning fossil fuels, and has much less effect on the environment.
    </p>
    <p>  
            Wind farms consist of many individual wind turbines, which are connected to the electric power transmission network. Onshore wind is an inexpensive source of electric power, competitive with or in many places cheaper than coal or gas plants. Onshore wind farms also have an impact on the landscape, as typically they need to be spread over more land than other power stations and need to be built in wild and rural areas, which can lead to "industrialization of the countryside" and habitat loss. 
    </p>
    <p>      
            Offshore wind is steadier and stronger than on land and offshore farms have less visual impact, but construction and maintenance costs are considerably higher. Small onshore wind farms can feed some energy into the grid or provide electric power to isolated off-grid locations.
    </p>
    <p>
            Wind is an intermittent energy source, which cannot make electricity nor be dispatched on demand. It also gives variable power,which is consistent from year to year but varies greatly over shorter time scales. Therefore, it must be used together with other electric power sources or batteries to give a reliable supply. As the proportion of wind power in a region increases, more conventional power sources are needed to back it up (such as fossil fuel power and nuclear power).
    </p>

    <h4>2. Solar Energy</h4>
    <img src="http://energy.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/future-of-solar-cover.jpg" alt="">
    <p>
            Solar power is the conversion of energy from sunlight into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics (PV), indirectly using concentrated solar power, or a combination. Concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. Photovoltaic cells convert light into an electric current using the photovoltaic effect.
    </p>
    <p>       
            Photovoltaics were initially solely used as a source of electricity for small and medium-sized applications,from the calculator powered by a single solar cell to remote homes powered by an off-grid rooftop PV system. Commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the 1980s.
    </p>
    <p>      
            As the cost of solar electricity has fallen, the number of grid-connected solar PV systems has grown into the millions and utility-scale photovoltaic power stations with hundreds of megawatts are being built. Solar PV is rapidly becoming an inexpensive, low-carbon technology to harness renewable energy from the Sun.
    </p>
    <p>
            Singapore has been putting in tremendous effort in trying to install the solar panels on several rooftops of buildings and offices. However, the implementation of solar panels has just started and most of our electricity still comes from no-renewable resources such as oil, coal and natural gas.
    </p>

    <h4>3. Hydroelectrics</h4>
    <img src="https://image.shutterstock.com/image-photo/view-dam-hydroelectric-power-station-260nw-1166660776.jpg" alt="">
    <p>
            Hydroelectricity is electricity produced from hydropower. In 2015, hydropower generated 16.6% of the world's total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity,[1] and was expected to increase about 3.1% each year for the next 25 years.
    </p>
    <p>
            Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 33 percent of global hydropower in 2013.
    </p>
    <p>
            The cost of hydroelectricity is relatively low, making it a competitive source of renewable electricity. The hydro station consumes no water, unlike coal or gas plants. The average cost of electricity from a hydro station larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kWh.
    </p>
    <p>
            With a dam and reservoir it is also a flexible source of electricity since the amount produced by the station can be varied up or down very rapidly (as little as a few seconds) to adapt to changing energy demands. Once a hydroelectric complex is constructed, the project produces no direct waste, and in many cases, has a considerably lower output level of greenhouse gases than fossil fuel powered energy plants.
    </p> 
    <p>
            Singapore has not considered hydroelectric power yet till this day and age. This is attributed to the fact that there are no streams nor reservoirs big enough to construct a dam.
    </p>

    <h4>4. Nuclear Energy</h4>
    <img src="https://www.funkidslive.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Untitled-1_0005_nuclear.jpg" alt="">
    <p>
            Nuclear power is the use of nuclear reactions that release nuclear energy to generate heat, which most frequently is then used in steam turbines to produce electricity in a nuclear power plant. As a nuclear technology, nuclear power can be obtained from nuclear fission, nuclear decay and nuclear fusion reactions.
    </p>
    <p>
            Presently, the vast majority of electricity from nuclear power is produced by nuclear fission of uranium and plutonium. Nuclear decay processes are used in niche applications such as radioisotope thermoelectric generators.
    </p>
    <p>
            Nuclear power is classified as a low greenhouse gas energy supply technology, along with renewable energy, by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Since its commercialization in the 1970s, nuclear power has prevented about 1.84 million air pollution-related deaths and the emission of about 64 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent that would have otherwise resulted from the burning of fossil fuels.
    </p>
    <p>
            Singapore is considering to build a nuclear power plant on one of the islands near Singapore. The Singaporean government feels that nuclear energy is very efficient yet inexpensive. True enough, the cost of building a nuclear power plant is definitely much less as compared to other renewable energy sources such as solar panels, wind turbines and hydroelectric dams. Furthermore, less greenhouse gases are released into the environment when nuclear energy is used compared to fossil fuels. However, there are disadvantages of nuclear power. For example, it is radioactive and if a nuclear mine explodes, chances of death and cancer in people will certainly increase.
    </p>

    <h4>5. Biomass</h4>
    <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSfTLlPG-a_IcVViUAkiU5p59u1HKU5aXlE95Lj-Dfhf5neipx7qQ" alt="">
    <p>
            Biomass is plant or animal material used for energy production, heat production, or in various industrial processes as raw material for a range of products. It can be purposely grown energy crops (e.g. miscanthus, switchgrass), wood or forest residues, waste from food crops (wheat straw, bagasse), horticulture (yard waste), food processing (corn cobs), animal farming (manure, rich in nitrogen and phosphorus), or human waste from sewage plants.
    </p>
    <p>
            Burning plant-derived biomass releases CO2, but it has still been classified as a renewable energy source in the EU and UN legal frameworks because photosynthesis cycles the CO2 back into new crops. In some cases, this recycling of CO2 from plants to atmosphere and back into plants can even be CO2 negative, as a relatively large portion of the CO2 is moved to the soil during each cycle.
    </p>
    <p>
            Cofiring with biomass has increased in coal power plants, because it makes it possible to release less CO2 without the cost associated with building new infrastructure. Co-firing is not without issues however, often an upgrade of the biomass is beneficiary. Upgrading to higher grade fuels can be achieved by different methods, broadly classified as thermal, chemical, or biochemical.
    </p>
    <p>
            Currently, there are quite a number of cars that use biomass to operate. Products such as wheat, corn, sugar cane and barley are used to generate electricity for these cars. Singapore is considering using algae as another option for biomass. Sadly, these car that use biomass as an energy source are in the minority as most cars in Singapore still rely on patrol.
    </p>

    <h4>6. Fossil Fuels</h4>
    <img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/70/118870-004-AF57639D.jpg" alt="">
    <p>
            A fossil fuel is a fuel formed by natural processes, such as anaerobic decomposition of buried dead organisms, containing energy originating in ancient photosynthesis. The age of the organisms and their resulting fossil fuels is typically millions of years, and sometimes exceeds 650 million years. Fossil fuels contain high percentages of carbon and include petroleum, coal, and natural gas.
    </p>
    <p>
            Other commonly used derivatives include kerosene and propane. Fossil fuels range from volatile materials with low carbon to hydrogen ratios like methane, to liquids like petroleum, to nonvolatile materials composed of almost pure carbon, like anthracite coal.
    </p>
    <p>
            Methane can be found in hydrocarbon fields either alone, associated with oil, or in the form of methane clathrates. 
    </p>
    <p>
            In 2017 the world's primary energy sources consisted of petroleum (34%), coal (28%), natural gas (23%), amounting to an 85% share for fossil fuels in primary energy consumption in the world. Non-fossil sources in 2006 included nuclear (8.5%), hydroelectric (6.3%), and others (geothermal, solar, tidal, wind, wood, waste) amounting to 0.9%. World energy consumption was growing at about 2.3% per year. In 2015 about 18% of worldwide consumption was from renewable sources.
    </p>
    <p>
            Although fossil fuels are continually being formed via natural processes, they are generally considered to be non-renewable resources because they take millions of years to form and the known viable reserves are being depleted much faster than new ones are being made.
    </p>
    <p>
            The use of fossil fuels raises serious environmental concerns. The burning of fossil fuels produces around 21.3 billion tonnes (21.3 gigatonnes) of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year. It is estimated that natural processes can only absorb about half of that amount, so there is a net increase of 10.65 billion tonnes of atmospheric carbon dioxide per year. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that increases radiative forcing and contributes to global warming. A global movement towards the generation of low-carbon renewable energy is underway to help reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.
